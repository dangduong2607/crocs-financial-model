    <p>Crocs continues to deliver strong operating performance and free cash flow. Despite this, the company trades at below-peer valuation multiples and has a moderate credit risk profile, suggesting the market may be underpricing both its cash-generative ability and capital structure stability. The valuation points to meaningful upside potential supported by conservative assumptions.</p>

    <h2>Qualitative Factors</h2>
    <h3>Porter's Five Forces</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Threat of New Entrants:</strong> Moderate to low. Strong branding and marketing by Crocs make market entry difficult for newcomers.</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining Power of Suppliers:</strong> Moderate. Use of proprietary Croslite material raises dependency but is offset by supplier diversification.</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining Power of Buyers:</strong> Moderate. Product differentiation lowers buyer power, though substitutes exist.</li>
      <li><strong>Threat of Substitutes:</strong> Moderate to high. Fashion trends and competing footwear brands pose switching risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Industry Rivalry:</strong> High. Competitive landscape includes Nike, Adidas, and Skechers with similar offerings.</li>

      <li><strong>Service & Expansion:</strong> Further growth into Asia and Europe with a global distribution footprint.</li>
    </ul>
