      <p><em>Crocs continues to deliver strong operating performance and free cash flow. Despite this, the company trades at below-peer valuation multiples and has a moderate credit risk profile, suggesting the market may be underpricing both its cash-generative ability and capital structure stability. The valuation points to meaningful upside potential supported by conservative assumptions.</em></p>
